Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository include the R code and a README.md in the repo describing how the script works and 
the codCodeBook.md describing the variables for the "Getting and Cleaning data" class project. tidydata.txt 
is the output of the R programming.
 
The run_analysis.R programming do the following jobs.

1.Download and unzip data and data description files from 
  http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
2.Read the training and the test data and set them together to create one data set.
3.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
4.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5.Labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
6.Creates tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Write
  the tidy data set to the tidydata.txt file.

CodeBook.md  describes the variables/data, and work that was performed to clean up the data.


tidydata.txt is the output of the run_analysis.R programming
